# Xypher

## A program for encoding/decoding text with various ciphers

Cryptography is an integral part of modern computing. This tool automates the use of common
*pre-computer* cipher algorithms to allow easy exploration of their applications. 

This tool could be used by anyone wishing to play around with or learn about simple ciphers.

Features:
 - Converts to and from common pre-computer ciphers.
 - Command-line use.

This topic is of interest to me because of the role that modern ciphers (encryption) play in
digital security today, and because of the mathematics that are involved.
