# Xypher

## A program for encoding/decoding text with various ciphers

Cryptography is an integral part of modern computing, and has an interesting and extensive history.
This tool automates the use of common *pre-computer* cipher algorithms to allow easy exploration 
of their applications. 

This tool could be used by anyone wishing to play around with or learn about simple ciphers.

Features:
 - Converts to and from common pre-computer ciphers.
 - Command-line use.

This topic is of interest to me because of the role that modern ciphers (encryption) play in
digital security today, and because of the mathematics that are involved.




## User Stories

### Phase 1:

I want to be able to:
- Select from a list of cipher algorithms.
- Configure settings for each algorithm (if available).
- User cipher algorithms to convert back and forth from legible text.
- Add algorithms to a list to be applied sequentially.
